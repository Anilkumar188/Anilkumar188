### About Me

I'm a data-driven professional transitioning from a successful background in **Market Research** to a focused career in **Data Analytics**. With 5+ years of experience analyzing market trends, consumer behavior, and business performance, I've developed a strong foundation in turning complex data into actionable insights.

My passion for working with data has led me to upskill in tools like **Power BI**, **SQL**, **Python**, and **Excel**â€”and I've already completed real-world analytics projects including:

- Bank Customer Churn Analysis Power BI & SQL
- Sales Dashboard Development in Power BI & SQL
- E-commerce Data Analysis using Excel & SQL
- Airbnb Listing Analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

I'm now actively applying my research mindset, business acumen, and analytical skills to roles in **Data Analysis**, **Business Intelligence**, and **Insights Reporting**â€”helping organizations make smarter, data-backed decisions.
